Here’s how this plan works:
On this plan, your monthly energy charge is based on the total amount of energy used for the month, no matter the time of day or day of week it’s used.

This plan has the same rates year-round based on your assigned usage tier.
You are assigned to one of three usage tiers based on your average energy use throughout the year.
Each year your usage will be automatically reviewed to determine if you are on the right tier. Check your monthly bill for updates about your average monthly usage and to track your progress. If you’re reassigned to a different tier, your first affected bill will be your January bill. You are eligible for a one-time waiver to maintain your current usage tier if you wish. Contact us >
