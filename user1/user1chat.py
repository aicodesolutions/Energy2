  the following benefits: Potential to save money by shifting energy use to off-peak hours, \
  Ability to manage energy costs by using less energy during on-peak hours. \
  The plan details are as follows: rateStructure: Time-of-use, onPeakHours: 4pm-7pm weekdays, \
  offPeakHours: all other hours, superOffPeakHours: 10am-3pm weekdays (winter months), \
  The rates are as follows: summer: onPeak: higher rate, offPeak: lower rate, winter: onPeak: higher rate,\
      offPeak: lower rate, superOffPeak: lowest rate.  The ways to save energy are: Shift use of major \
        appliances to off-peak hours, Use less energy during on-peak hours, Use delay settings on appliances, Adjust pool pump timer.\
